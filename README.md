or directly [click this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/furnstahl/8805_binder_example/HEAD) to start up the Binder version of the directory with two notebooks (it may take a while to get set up; be patient).

* radioactive_lighthouse_exercise.ipynb is the notebook for the students to fill in answers as they execute (it will give errors until some code is added).
* radioactive_lighthouse_exercise_key.ipynb is the same notebook with sample answers (this should run without errors).
